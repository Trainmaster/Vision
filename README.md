## Contribution Guideline

### Commit Messages

*  Prefix your Commit Message with a meaningful identifier followed by a colon.
*  A list of possible identifiers: Fix, Update, Improve/Enhance, Merge, Add, Remove, Deprecate
*  **Do not** use the simple past tense, use the infinitive form: ~~Fixed~~ -> Fix
*  Summarize your commit in a few words. If needed, use an extended description.
*  Refrain from introducing excessive changes in one commit. Keep the commit as small as possible.
*  An example of a good commit message: `Fix: handling of invalid arguments`
